# Chip8 ROM Game Selection Menu
This project will hopefully eventually contain a ROM for a Chip8 emulator that allows for selecting a game to be played. This will obviously require support from the outside language, as the Chip8 emulator has no capabilities to load files or similar on its own.

## The Goal
I want to create a menu in entirely Octo (Chip8 assembly language), that can display a list of games to be played, allow the user to scroll through it, and make a selection.
The output would then be stored in a specific place in memory, that the outside program could then read and load said rom into the emulator.

## Notes
I know this would have been simpler to do entirely in a programming language, but I created a Chip8 emulator and thought it would be cool to make my own rom. So, instead of creating another Snake rom, which I'm sure dozens if not more others have done, I made this.
